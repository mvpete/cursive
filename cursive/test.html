        <h1>Code Blocks</h1>

        <p>Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both 
            <code><pre></code>
 and 
            <code><code></code>
 tags. </p>

        <code>This is a code block.</code>

        <p>Here is an example of AppleScript: </p>

        <code>end tell</code>

        <p>A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article). </p>

        <code></div></code>

        <p>Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means it's also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax. </p>

        <code>beep
end tell
</code>
