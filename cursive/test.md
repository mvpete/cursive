### Code Blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or
markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines
of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block
in both `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the
block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.

Here is an example of AppleScript:

    tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell

A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented
(or the end of the article).

Within a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`)
are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very
easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown -- just paste
it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the
ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:

    <div class="footer">
        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
    </div>

Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,
asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means
it's also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax.

```
tell application "Foo"
    beep
end tell
```
